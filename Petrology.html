<h1> PETROLOGY</h1>

<p>Petrology,  a branch of <a href="Geology.html">Geology</a>, is a Scientific study of rocks and <a href="Minerals.html">minerals</a> that deals with their composition, texture, and structure; their occurrence and distribution; and their origin in relation to physicochemical conditions and geologic processes.</p>
    
<p>It is concerned with all three major types of rocksâ€”igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. </p>

<p>Other branches of Geology like <a href="Structural Geology.html"> Structural Geology</a> and <a href="Engineering Geology.html">Engineering GeologyGeology</a> uses the classification of petrology of rocks when they conduct their study of orientation and physical properties of rock.</p>

<p>The classification and detail study of rock on its surface and within helped geologists to easly explore other planets of the solar system. </p> 

<span>It can be concluded that petrology is an essential part of Geology.</span>
