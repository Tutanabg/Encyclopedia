<h1>GEOLOGY</h1>

<p>It is the science that deals with the earthâ€™s physical structure and substance its history and the processes that act on it. Geology has several disciplines and some of them include:</p>
<ol >

     <li><a id="discipline" href="Petrology.html">Petrology</a></li>

     <li><a id="discipline"href="Structural Geology.html">Structural Geology</a></li>

     <li><a id="discipline" href="Engineering Geology.html"</a>Engineering Geology</li>

     <li><a id="discipline" href="Minerals.html">Mineralogy</a></li>

</ol>

Geology has also direct interaction with different natural science deceplines which includes:
<ul class="Science">

     <li>Physics</li>

     <li>Chemistry</li>

     <li>Biology.</li>

</ul>

<p>This natural science decipline gives the advantage to understand our planet in interdisciplinary and entertaining way so that any Geology student can achive his/hers goal by implementing the scientific principles from different point of view. </p>

<p>In conclution if you are considering to persue your field of study in Geology you will have different apportunities as student and also in your carrier life. </p>
